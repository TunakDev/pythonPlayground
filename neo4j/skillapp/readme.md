The purpose of this part of the project is to create an application to save the skills of
coworkers in a database which can be queried to find suitable people for project,
localize missing skills and have an overview of the currently available skills.

The plan for this is to create a neo4j graph-database, add the currently available data
and provide an API for CRUD operations.

Later on I want to build a frontend where you can interact with the skill-database
and a possibility to use the api in other programs.

I will use the already available neo4j database in the folder ../graphdatabase
(dont forget to change the password when you first use it)



It should be possible later on to upload whole profiles of people
with their corresponding skills and projects
