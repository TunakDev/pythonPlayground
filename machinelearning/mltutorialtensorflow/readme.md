to preprocess the data first run preprocessMushroomData.py


number of neurons in final layer indicates the number of outputs
e.g: 
- final layer has one neuron for a single value (number)
- final layer has one neuron for a boolean value (true, false)
- final layer has 10 neurons to decide which of the 10 outputs is the most likely
