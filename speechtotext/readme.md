# Talking with your LLM

To make the LLM experience more accessible while e.g. coding I want to talk to my LLM.
The easiest approach seems to be using TTS and STT to speak the prompt into a microphone and output the 
answer on a headset.

TODO:
- Learn more about language packages (german?)
- Use other voices
- https://thepythoncode.com/article/convert-text-to-speech-in-python
  - I want to run it locally - no API involved!

## Speech to text
- speech recognition by google (no API!)

## Text to speech
